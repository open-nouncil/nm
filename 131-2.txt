{segments: [{speaker: spk_1, start: 256, text:  Yeah, and then we can keep cruising along. We'll go on to the candidates section. Trying to see. Okay. JB, do you want to just post a link to your candidate?}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 269, text:  And then you can give an overview of what your candidate is and when you plan on going on chain with it.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 275, text:  Okay. So I'm linking the original is we're in Kanaka. Are you also in Japan? I'm sorry. We're in Bali.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 287, text:  I feel your pain.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 290, text:  So, guys, I've just posted the candidate proposal in there. This is the original one that we posted a while back.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 298, text:  And so I'm going to use my time here. Can I go up as quick as possible? I promise I'm going to use my time here to basically shoot the shit with you guys about the updated proposal that we're going to build based off of this one.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 309, text:  So just a refresher. That proposal in there is called Project Verb.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 313, text:  And Project Verb was this idea of building a noun ish intelligence using the proof of knowledge protocol.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 320, text:  So what we're building at Decide World, my company, and Carlos is the CTO, ATOX.E is also in the call.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 326, text:  We're building this thing called proof of knowledge. And it's basically a data model for large scale decentralized vector databases, which basically means a knowledge base that an AI can read.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 339, text:  And it's a multiplayer knowledge base. So you can create multiple of these knowledge bases in a decentralized way and they can all query each other.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 347, text:  So the purpose of proof of knowledge is basically to allow for decentralized knowledge exchange and a creation of a basically fundamental units of knowledge, which can be used on chain for many varieties of use cases.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 360, text:  A lot of complexity there. But the point being, we wanted to give a very early use case of this for Project Verb, which was essentially an intelligence, an AI intelligence that represents the nouns.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 372, text:  And it would basically have been trained on the nouns documentation, the chat history, the transcripts of these discussions, Telegram bot, Discord bot, accumulating all of the text that's been spoken about.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 385, text:  And it would create this knowledge base, which is a representation of who the nouns are, what they talk about, what they're working on.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 391, text:  Then you can use that as an agent to basically do things. And I know Wiz, is he still in the call? Yeah, he is. Great.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 397, text:  I know Wiz was talking about this at the beginning of the call, about how in particular governance, governance can be really streamlined and improved by having some kind of AI that's trained well on this sort of data.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 410, text:  So an example would be the nounish intelligence could pre-vet proposals. And instead of you guys having to do all the pre-vet proposals or in the early stage, then it would say it would give you feedback to the proposal and say, this is probably not going to pass.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 425, text:  You should optimize it. So that was the original proposal was Project Verb. Now we got some feedback, initial feedback.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 432, text:  We didn't come and push it back, push back on sort of pushing the candidate proposal because of some ideas that we had for optimizing and improving the value proposition.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 442, text:  The proposal that we're going to put forward, which is an extension of this original one, is basically for a Magic the Gathering style card game.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 454, text:  OK. And this is actually how we're optimizing Project Verb moving forward or optimizing Proof of Knowledge moving forward.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 460, text:  It's essentially the data units within this system are going to be held as cards and the cards can be you can think about Magic the Gathering as a card.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 468, text:  There's certain classes, there's certain attributes, there's certain types.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 473, text:  And this is basically how we're categorizing the information with Proof of Knowledge. And it will be categorized like a card.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 479, text:  And so the purpose of Proof of Knowledge is actually to basically organize the many hundreds of thousands of cards of knowledge in the deck, in the protocol into decks.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 489, text:  And a deck is just a collection of cards that has a particular theme or a particular sort of coherence to it.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 496, text:  So, for example, you could create a nouns deck and a nouns deck would contain pieces of information or these units of knowledge,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 505, text:  these cards that pertain to who nouns are, what they do, individual members of nouns,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 511, text:  maybe some things that you guys have funded, where you met, the origin story, anything such as this,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 516, text:  which each individual piece of context is a single card and you can have every nouns dao member,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 523, text:  every nouns holder could have their own card. So each noun would have its own card.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 527, text:  But then nouns dao would have a card and the proposals that go live would have a card.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 531, text:  And you're basically building a deck of cards that consists of all of the context of nouns.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 537, text:  And the point of this is that now you have a deck of cards which someone can play against or be played with.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 542, text:  That essentially allows you to explain who nouns are or like what they're currently up to or what they've previously been up to,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 549, text:  or like as like an initial who are nouns or moving forward what are nouns doing.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 553, text:  And it's really exciting because it's a very clever way to organize the knowledge within a knowledge base,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 560, text:  which is quite a difficult thing as with if you read our proposal,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 563, text:  we've mentioned some of these challenges is basically the pipelines of how you store this data.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 569, text:  We've kind of solved that right with proof of knowledge, which is really exciting.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 572, text:  But this the card use case means that you can actually have these physical collectibles, right,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 577, text:  which represent the individual pieces of knowledge, the individual nouns, the nouns dao itself.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 583, text:  And these individual cards are also held on chain as an object, which can be used in this sort of collaborative knowledge sharing.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 591, text:  It can be used for study. You can be used for basically storytelling.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 595, text:  And it can also be used for like an actual game, like there's real game mechanics behind it as well.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 600, text:  So you can play the actual Magic the Gathering games. And that's a really exciting use case.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 605, text:  So there's a lot of complexities of what we've built, right, which is kind of a problem.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 611, text:  And in our first our first proposal, some of the feedback we got is like too much information.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 617, text:  So I wanted to come to this call and basically give you the verbal spiel of like, this is what it is.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 621, text:  This is why it's cool and sort of get some feedback from you guys now about what it is that I've said that you actually care about.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 628, text:  And what it is that I could actually, you know, write into the city, the next candidate proposal that is of interest,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 633, text:  because it took me a while to write that last one. And basically it was like, do too much writing.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 638, text:  So I don't want to do that again. I want to sort of make it so that it's digestible for people, so that people are interested.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 644, text:  Ultimately, it boils down to the proposal will be we want to, using proof of knowledge, create a nouns deck,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 652, text:  a deck of cards which has physical printout collectibles, each of which will be a representation of like either your noun or the contributions you've made to nouns now.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 662, text:  And whenever those cards are pulled throughout the future history of proof of knowledge protocol being live,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 669, text:  those cards being pulled or used in other people's decks to explain a DOW or to explain who the nouns like,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 674, text:  someone else wants to use your card to explain something that they are arguing, those retrievals are tracked.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 679, text:  And so your card is actually basically the tracking mechanism for how often your knowledge is used.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 684, text:  And in the long run, we want to do something where, you know, if your card is retrieved a hundred times and you get a shiny version,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 691, text:  like your card is a representation as an NFT upgrades to a shiny version because it's had more queries and such.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 697, text:  And so a lot of really interesting things to explore there. But that's the purpose of our discussion here is like what it is that people are interested in that we can then put onto the proposal.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 705, text:  So it doesn't get boring for people.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 709, text:  The future is bright for the people that always find themselves being like, but that's what I said.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 716, text:  I mean, yeah, for real.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 719, text:  Is this for some reason I thought this was like one thing and then it kind of like shifted to another.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 726, text:  Is this kind of like scoops, I guess, where it's kind of like you have this card and then based on like activity or engagement,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 733, text:  the card is more valuable and like levels up or am I just thinking of this completely different?}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 741, text:  Hey, so this is just a way to create sort of a dynamic that allows us to create a representation of the context, basically.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 755, text:  Previously, we've tried I mean, we've reached the point where we have the agents ready to interact.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 761, text:  We always had the like the issue of like, what do we give the agent as tools?}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 768, text:  Right. And and it can be all sorts of things. So like this is a data structure that actually works alongside with any other reputation validation system.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 780, text:  So it can be be used on top of that or like as a like a layer to that.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 787, text:  And the idea here is that this would allow us to create sort of a story that we can represent in these like units of knowledge that serve like for different purposes.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 802, text:  So they can be used for human readable interactions, like as a physical object, but also they can be used for retrieval and for these other systems that are coming online of validation, reputation and like sort of sorting.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 816, text:  And even extra qualities. And this is a term that's coming up in the industry called knowledge supply chain logistics, where you have an item of knowledge that gets passed through different protocols and get sort of rubber stamped and get a cruise}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 832, text:  value over time as different groups of people imprint their views on that.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 839, text:  I don't know if that answers the question.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 844, text:  Yeah, that sounds good.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 847, text:  Does anyone else?}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 849, text:  Yeah, of course, definitely.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 851, text:  Um,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 853, text:  I think some of this is interesting.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 857, text:  I have a hard time figuring out like, what is it that you you're trying to solve?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 865, text:  So for instance, like, are you trying to build something to solve problems that you see announced? Or is it something else that you're trying to do?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 876, text:  This is a much larger problem of like coordination of information and coordination of knowledge across like, okay, globally in the real world.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 885, text:  Yes, this is a big problem. There's lots of people with lots of ideas that don't know the other people are working on these ideas.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 891, text:  There's a real difficulty in us and kind of coming to a table and have an explanation to understand what each other talking about.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 896, text:  That's the grand vision. Right. But talking just specifically about on chain.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 901, text:  There's a real difficulty of having some of this, like some of the things that you're trying to communicate as a DAO being known outside of the DAO.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 909, text:  Right. And so we're just trying to like develop what we've we've developed already.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 914, text:  These sort of primitives that allow people to capture what it is they're doing.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 919, text:  Is it what the activities that the DAO is doing? Is it the knowledge that they know? Is it the study that they're working on?}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 924, text:  Is it the internal operations of their project? Whatever it is, these are like pieces of information that we've figured out a way to capture.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 932, text:  Right. And now you can use this piece of information because they're vectorized and passed by AI to basically coordinate globally.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 939, text:  And whenever those pieces of information are used by the AI, there's a tracking metric going on here that basically says it was used for this.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 947, text:  And that's a point basically. And so for nouns in particular, you have this initial proposal was like,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 954, text:  get all the information of what nouns are doing into the into the system and then use this information to inform a bot to basically improve nouns, operations, coordination, governance proposals and such things as that.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 966, text:  And then also be able to use that as an agent to communicate to the outside world who are nouns and what they're up to at this particular moment in time.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 973, text:  The cards are just a representation of that data object, right? Like the cards are the way that they're being stored in our database.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 981, text:  And because they're cards, they have the added benefit of being able to look like a card, like a playing card.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 987, text:  And, you know, you can actually then basically make an NFT out of it and you can play the game with it and you can print them out.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 993, text:  And we're going to be printing out and we're going to be printing out like a Deci World deck where people, Deci World is our company, right? Deci World deck, which contains information about me, about Carlos, about the protocols, about what we've been up to, our conferences.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1005, text:  And then people can like play with the deck or read the deck or get played against by items of the deck to understand those things a bit better.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1013, text:  And so nouns could have its own deck, which explains who nouns are, what they're doing, but also it's like a physical thing as well. So that's in some ways extra though.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1023, text:  OK, perfect. And then, yeah, just one more one more question before we move on. And next we'll have Tagawa share his Kitpaws candidate and then we'll go to the park. But yeah, when did you plan on going on chain with us?}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1046, text:  Sorry, so going on chain, so we are kind of like live in beta of the data organization stuff in terms of having live on chain for the first deck of cards basically to be printed out.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1064, text:  We're going to do that ourselves. So Deci World is going to have like the first deck of cards. And we plan to do that by the end of October.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1071, text:  We're going to be here in Chiang Mai in Thailand until after Defcon from October 5th until after Defcon. So any of you other guys in Chiang Mai, please holler or meet up.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1081, text:  We plan to basically mint the on chain objects and the real world printing of the cards of the Deci World cards.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1087, text:  And if nouns accept our proposal, we would like to put nouns as the second deck of cards.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1092, text:  We're working alongside some really great partners for the sort of the data storage and the indexing and the sort of knowledge primitive layer.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1102, text:  And they also want to basically have their own deck of cards. And so we're going to basically working with our closest partners to print these out in terms of decentralized permissionless access to the creation of cards.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1114, text:  That'll be toward the end of the year. But the protocol is built. The on chain aspects are built. It's just about essentially deciding the rollout, which is we're going to start with Deci World as the first deck of cards.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1127, text:  But then it will be pretty soon after that everyone can contribute in a permissionless way to build their own cards.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1132, text:  I think she means the on chain proposal for nouns.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1135, text:  Oh, god damn sorry.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1137, text:  Yes. Sorry. I just I was like waiting for you to like get there. And then I was like, wait, I think he might be a misunderstanding.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1144, text:  I appreciate you guys letting me ramble on that. But yeah. OK. What is it going to go live on the same?}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1149, text:  Hopefully by it's my birthday tomorrow, actually, guys. So I might take tomorrow. But maybe by Monday.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1160, text:  Oh, yeah. And pre happy birthday. Definitely. Best way to spend your birthday is is with nouns somehow.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1168, text:  So, yeah, if you put that proposal up, that'd be awesome.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1171, text:  Yeah. In fact, we wait 30 minutes. I'm ready to set up my birthday with you guys.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1175, text:  Awesome. So, yeah, definitely looking forward to seeing it go on chain. And then, yeah, feel free to come back next week and you can share more when it is on chain.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1187, text:  And then, yeah, if anyone has any questions or comments, definitely feel free to message anyone on the team.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1195, text:  And perfect. Thank you for the time, but please, anyone, if you have any thoughts on this thing, like because we're building it, we're very serious about building it and it's super dope what we're building.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1204, text:  If you have any thoughts on how you can contribute, any problems you see, just please DM me or text me or whatever.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1209, text:  I'd be really interested to hear some more feedback before we write the proposal because we want to get it right.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1214, text:  So thank you. Perfect.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1221, text:  Sounds good. All right. Yeah. So if we keep cruising along to the next candidate, Tagawa and Kinoto, if you guys want to share about your proposal for the KIPAS.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1236, text:  Can you hear me? Yes.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1240, text:  Yes. Yep. Perfect.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1243, text:  Yeah. Thank you. The first one, thank you for giving me the chance to talk and also thank you for the big smile to Kim and also directly you sleep there.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1258, text:  And also, I just apologize to make noise last time.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1269, text:  So we just opened the mic and won't just need to read somewhere.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1274, text:  So why are you just asleep last time?}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1278, text:  Anyway, so I very exciting to showcase our proposal candidate here.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1290, text:  After that, we failed the proposal once last time.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1297, text:  We just did a rush after the proposal to reduce the cost because we get many advice from now known as the nouns camp last time.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1318, text:  So we just try to update our proposal.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1329, text:  So the point we changed from the last proposal was to reduce the number of the American new color with KIPAS.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1341, text:  But we just focus on creating the new color on the six pieces of the now niche color and also on the six,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1386, text:  the workshop and also our use of our cast or gathering to promote our project with nouns in Japan.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1398, text:  And also we try to get a US guide who is a member of our community to be the KIPAS instructor to expand such a culture with nouns from Japan to US side.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1425, text:  Because there is no overshooting instructor with the KIPAS at the moment.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1434, text:  So it's a very good chance to spread out and a very huge group to be spread out.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1446, text:  The KIPAS with nouns overshoots with us such as our overshooting instructor.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1461, text:  So we were excited to spread out the Japanese KIPAS.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1471, text:  One thing I think is important for people to know is after your guys' last proposal, I had spent some time and went on the nouns down Japan slash P nouns, X spaces that they have and they had a translator there.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1494, text:  So the show was probably about an hour long.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1498, text:  But I got to actually understand more of what this is.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1502, text:  So and I'm not sure if this comes across in the proposal, but for anyone that's not familiar with what KIPAS is, because to be honest, when I thought it was just coloring, right?}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1513, text:  Like I thought it was just kind of like a coloring book or a type of crayon.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1516, text:  But for those that don't know, KIPAS is actually like a traditional Japanese practice of a style of art.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1524, text:  So to be a KIPAS instructor, you know, you have to go through this intensive training and there's only about like 240 KIPAS trainers, instructors in the world.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1536, text:  And currently they're all in Japan right now.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1538, text:  So part of this proposal is that they're going to have Midas fly out to Japan and partake in this workshop for him to be able to become a KIPAS instructor.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1554, text:  Is that correct?}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1556, text:  Yes. Yes. Yes. Thanks.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1558, text:  Yes. And that's huge because now with him being a KIPAS instructor, now he can help with that flywheel and then he could host those trainings and workshops in the U.S.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1570, text:  And then it can slowly help, you know, proliferate this type of art and style.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1577, text:  And then another thing that's interesting is the nounish color.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1581, text:  So this would be nouns actually getting its own color within this kind of like set of colors.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1594, text:  So that's unique because, you know, you have the first run and then think of it kind of like yoga. Right.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1602, text:  So everyone knows yoga. It's really popular.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1604, text:  Everyone knows you have to go through this intensive training to become a yogi, which means you get to teach your own classes.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1611, text:  And there are certain tools that every yoga teacher needs. Right. Like there's your yoga mat. There's the blocks. There's all these type of tools.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1618, text:  So it's the same thing with with KIPAS is, you know, they have to have these like these tools.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1623, text:  So for nouns to be able to get a custom color within that kind of tool set that could be potentially picked up and used by these teachers all across Japan.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1635, text:  I mean, that's pretty exciting, too. Yeah, I think I think there's a lot of exciting things within this proposal.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1642, text:  But I think if people don't people don't understand kind of the overall vision of it, you know,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1650, text:  people may think that this is just, you know, a coloring prop or to have art.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1659, text:  Yeah, I can jump in real quick. Can you hear me? Yes.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1663, text:  Yes, it is. Hello, everyone. So essentially, so we have proof of the concept from our workshop that we did and the end of March this year.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1676, text:  We're you know, we had to go to the next line, come from Japan to my state, Illinois, to run a series of workshops at elementary school library.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1687, text:  And, you know, like they're pretty much like it's kind of weird to hear people say they're honored to have this have this take place there.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1695, text:  But they were and we were able to host these were hopes to host these workshops with the same KIPAS packaging and to go out on as the instructor, you know, for art class and an entire group of children on a Saturday at the library.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1714, text:  And the mural that we made on the window, the larger window at the library is still up. They haven't watched it.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1721, text:  And, you know, for the children at the elementary school, the entire every teacher in that school came into that art room to to observe what was taking place because nothing like this workshop is taking place at that school before.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1733, text:  I doubt anything like that is taking place in any school in this county and any place in this state. Just the way that the instructor kind of it's different from just an art instruction class.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1744, text:  Like this, what I was saying about like a yoga instructor, like, you know, it's very much a decentralized art theme, decentralized art workshop for children where there's no there's no way to just do this.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1760, text:  This one thing, you know, they're they're all coming together. They're they're they have their own space or they all share space. They create one big thing or a series of things that come together to form one large mural.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1775, text:  You know, it's very much different from how normal artists practice or taught in the U.S.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1783, text:  And the idea for this proposal is to expand that. So the entire point of going to receive the training is to be able to be become an official instructor myself and allow there to be space to have workshops all over the state, all over this region and encourage more people to become instructors and have workshops and instructors all over this country.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1812, text:  And not just this country, but this continent and other continents. So it's an ecosystem that is kind of tag teaming kid passing nouns to come together and proliferate.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1824, text:  So take what's already in Japan and expand and spread that philosophy globally.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1832, text:  Yes.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1836, text:  Thanks. Thanks for the explanation.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1838, text:  They still tell me that you are the poor English person.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1842, text:  Yeah, I'm very proud of you.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1847, text:  I hope you support. And thanks a bit, Spider.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1851, text:  And also in terms of the K-Pasta, we have a video movie about the K-Pasta who established this since 50 years ago.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1860, text:  So yeah, they have a huge history.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1865, text:  So Tarasan, YouTube channel, Kita-Pass.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1870, text:  Hi, it's Kita-Pass.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1872, text:  Hi.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1873, text:  Hi, Harimasu.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1874, text:  I asked Tarasan to paste the link of the YouTube movie about the K-Pasta. Please check out the movie.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1888, text:  Then everyone knows what the K-Pasta is.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1892, text:  Yes.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1894, text:  I guess I should explain the other deliverables.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1899, text:  Excuse me.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1901, text:  So we have the Nounish, not just the Nounish Theme packaging, but the Nounish colors as well.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1908, text:  So we have a tool that will have a process for selecting those colors and hopefully involve, we look to involve the community in the selection of those colors to include those in the packaging.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1924, text:  So with the, this is all kind of centered around the workshop ecosystem, to where these K-Pasts will be given out at the workshops.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1934, text:  So all of these children, children are, it's not just for children either.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1938, text:  They're not just crayons. There's professional artists that use this material as well.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1944, text:  So these workshops are open to, you know, if it's at a school, of course children, but if it's, you know, we're doing this mostly like community centers, libraries, like kind of like, you know, to provide a social benefit.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1962, text:  So kids, adults, teens.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1965, text:  Last workshop we had kids and teens show up.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1968, text:  But what I wanted to focus on, what we wanted to focus on this time around is actually having a way to show kind of actionable metrics so that the Nouns community can see, you know, that, okay, there are people that are participating and engaging with this.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1985, text:  And we are doing something, we are making some kind of impact or impression at least that is more than just like a number one or like a like, or like say that this person attended.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1995, text:  So we created the, we're creating a coloring book that is using synthetic paper that can be reused, washed and reused because K-Pasts is a reusable, reusable material.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 2008, text:  So there's going to feature, if you've seen Tagalogsan's fan art for the Nounish characters, Nounish assets, the NFTs, you're going to feature those.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 2022, text:  So hopefully we can have, they will have some way to have an enhanced way to feature those, those assets in this book, you know, black and white outline.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 2031, text:  So the children can color over those and, you know, you know, like in the way that they want to.}]}


{segments: [{speaker: spk_0, start: 0, text:  the distinct character and the kids can like color them however they please. However they,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 4, text:  you know, their imagination and then we hear from that coloring book is going to be a QR code that,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 10, text:  you know, an interface where the children can like scan this QR code and it uploads that image}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 16, text:  directly to a far caster gallery that we are also creating. Yes, so there'll be a way to kind of}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 24, text:  keep track of actionable, more actionable metrics like, okay, well, we can see that this child has}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 30, text:  this participant is engaged or participating in these workshops through the coloring book,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 36, text:  which uploads directly to a far caster gallery and everyone can kind of see that}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 40, text:  and also use that for their own. It's like a content when we talk about the}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 49, text:  content creation. So it becomes content for promotion across kid past nouns and the individual}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 57, text:  and the artist themselves. Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, I mean, I'm definitely looking forward to}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 63, text:  this prop. Would love to hear, does anyone have any questions or comments? I know previously}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 70, text:  in the last prop, which I mean even myself, again, that was before I took the time and}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 75, text:  went on the Twitter space with the interpreter, but I felt like the previous prop was kind of}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 80, text:  more of a travel prop. I thought it was just funding Tagawa to go host an art workshop.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 91, text:  Yeah, I just didn't really understand exactly what it was. So I'm thankful for you guys having}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 97, text:  the interpreter and having that Twitter space. But yeah, we'd love to hear if anyone else has}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 103, text:  any questions or comments. And then also when do you guys plan on going on chain with it?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 110, text:  Kinado, when do you guys plan on going on chain? Or do you need a sponsor?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 126, text:  Yeah, as a sponsor, we have a sponsor. They will want to be a sponsor.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 141, text:  So}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 154, text:  last time, and also PIPE are used to sponsor, but now we have to look at the sponsor. So we need to}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 166, text:  sponsor right now. So those who are interested in our proposal to be the sponsor, we are very}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 174, text:  grateful. Okay, that makes sense. Does anyone else have any questions or comments about the}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 183, text:  Kitpaz proposal? No? Okay. Well, yeah, thank you. Thank you so much, Kinado and Tagawa and Midas}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 199, text:  for coming to share about the proposal. And yeah, once you have a sponsor, we look forward to seeing}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 205, text:  it go on chain. Perfect. All right. So then let's keep cruising along. Derek with the park,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 214, text:  you wanted to share next? Do you have a candidate that's up if you want to just drop the link?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 221, text:  Yeah, happy Friday, GM. Thank you, Bix. Thank you, everyone here for giving us the time.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 229, text:  We're here to bring the fun just like the Kitpaz crew. I have Tim Anderson and Josh Lippe and Ben}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 240, text:  Schwir as well here, fellow founders of the Park Dow. Just wanted to put this candidate up for}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 250, text:  everyone to see a huge opportunity go through it. And we have Tim here to share a little bit more}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 257, text:  about what we're working on. Because I think a lot of people here know me or David T. Thorne, but}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 262, text:  just want to want people to understand the depth and the scope of how big the park really is.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 271, text:  Davin's here too worldwide. Yeah, Tim, are you there? Hey, guys, can you hear me?}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 280, text:  Thanks, Derek. And it's super inspiring to be here. First off, I want to say shout out}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 286, text:  Prop 646. Having watched Davin's journey as a park member and what he's building with the}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 292, text:  school is just extremely inspiring and the Kitpaz as well. Yeah, for those none of you probably know}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 299, text:  me, we founded the park and Friday's at the park years ago to sort of do this weekly discovery of}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 307, text:  how do we understand this world more and then how do we bring it out to the rest of the world. My}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 311, text:  background is songwriting and music production. I've worked with artists and written songs for}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 317, text:  people like Billie Eilish and Solange and Banks and all these artists and had a great career in}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 323, text:  there. And my sort of passion and goal and dream was always to figure out once I discovered what}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 330, text:  the blockchain was, like how do you use it as a resource for making equity with song writes,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 341, text:  ownerships, splits, all these things that are really broken in the regular world. I believe}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 347, text:  what we're doing and what we're pushing for, even though it's still really early, is sort of like}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 351, text:  the future. But more importantly, it's just inspiring. It just gives a way to show that}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 356, text:  there's other types of bleeding edge technology that can power human creativity. And so while}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 365, text:  Derek has really been a shepherd for us and helped us understand and see all these amazing}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 368, text:  opportunities, the four of us really work every week to learn what can we offer, how do we show}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 376, text:  people, especially young artists, young people, that this world is not like closed off like a}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 383, text:  space they can't access, that it's more of a way to build yourself and build ownership into what}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 390, text:  you're doing. So yeah, with that said, we've had this real sort of journey recently into a more}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 396, text:  educational landscape. I think taking what we've done with music, winning Grammys, playing}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 402, text:  festivals, doing activations, all these things, really keep it at the core to use on-chain}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 409, text:  technologies and these kind of communities to spread love, for lack of a better word.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 416, text:  And then people want to know, well, what is this? Oh, nouns. What is that? Bass. What is that? I}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 420, text:  don't understand. Because a lot of the artists, everyone in this world, especially artists, not}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 425, text:  just musicians, it's just a grind. You're just trying to survive. And anyone can stop me when}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 430, text:  I'm ranting for too long. But inside that grind, there isn't a lot of time to look around and see,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 435, text:  what can I do? How do I understand this technology? Or is this, you know, what does this}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 439, text:  do for me? And we're at a pivotal moment where the Spotify's of the world and the way that music and}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 445, text:  art has become monetized is really upside down. And we see that it favors a very select few.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 451, text:  So our goal is to create a world-class space that educates and inspires young people, musicians,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 460, text:  artists, to see that there are people like nouns who try to put their money where their mouth is}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 465, text:  and use resources to create unbelievable works of art to inspire. There are spaces like this with}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 472, text:  the Grammys. That's where our studio and our proposal lives. Currently, we work inside the}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 478, text:  Grammy Foundation in their building. And this space that became available, it would be sort of}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 484, text:  partially sponsored by the Grammy Museum and a few other nonprofits that we work with. And we want to}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 490, text:  like, I don't know, we just want to go really aggressively into this space of educating people}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 495, text:  around music and art and put the on-chain thing in there eloquently, like we've always tried,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 500, text:  so that it is inspiring. It's more of like, what is this? I'm having a nouns coffee while I'm}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 505, text:  learning how to make ambient music or meditate. And these kids maybe start to like, wonder what}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 510, text:  this is, ask questions, and yeah, grow something. There's a vacant area. There was Red Bull Music}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 518, text:  Academy, even the Grammy Museum and these other foundations used to be funded better.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 523, text:  But there's just this lack of educational programming, specifically for music, for people}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 528, text:  who are underprivileged or don't have resources to it. We've worked with Watts Community Corps,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 533, text:  we're working with the LBC Hero Squad, and we're finding ways to use music as a magic}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 539, text:  trick to unlock other things. And that's what this proposal is about. We just see an opportunity}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 546, text:  right within our grasp to do something kind of bold and put noggles everywhere and make it a}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 552, text:  nouns experience where there's classes for kids, classes for adults. We will make songs all day,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 559, text:  every day like we do now. They go on chain, they go on Apple and Spotify, and they just sort of}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 565, text:  grow this brand that we've been building every day, but mainly on Fridays, Happy Friday for the}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 570, text:  last five years. And yeah, just take it out, use education and music as a method for really taking}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 579, text:  this brand you guys have and making it as recognizable as everyone wants, and also trying}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 585, text:  to do some real public good. Yeah, very long and short of it.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 595, text:  Yeah, I'm just taking a look at the candidate right now. Yeah, it's interesting, I'm not sure if you just saw the proposal that went up}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 602, text:  from Gommie, but he kind of was trying to tackle the like an issue of, you know, like music}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 609, text:  distribution and he was going to be doing stuff with Zora and Bass as well. Yeah, I mean I feel}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 617, text:  like this is obviously a candidate, so yeah, a few questions. One, like when did you guys plan on}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 624, text:  going on chain with this or is this kind of just like, you know, like in phase just put it up, get}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 630, text:  tons of feedback, and then maybe rework a little and then go on chain or what was your guys's}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 636, text:  thoughts? We're looking to go on chain on Friday with this. The opportunity does have some urgency}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 644, text:  to it because the space that is opened up in the building is kind of rare and also sought after.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 654, text:  So the urgency for us to make this happen is based off of like the DNA of this room. Like I}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 664, text:  don't really like to, you know, brag's not the right word, but just like I just want people to}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 674, text:  highlight or just understand that like Universal Music Group was in this room for the last three}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 680, text:  years. You know, the console that Jagged Little Pill from Alanis Morissette was made was in that}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 688, text:  room. It's like it's a really special place and way for us to kind of deepen Noun's awareness to}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 697, text:  some of the biggest people in the world for the music industry. Like we want to bring Noguls to}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 703, text:  the Grammys like proper to the Grammy Museum and the people that are in this building}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 710, text:  are all, you know, deeply a part of those things. So there is urgency just for the space. I do want}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 726, text:  to say too in terms of like the importance of a studio like that, when you are an artist of a certain level, you don't really spend much time in studios that are not at that level.

start: 1217, text:  yeah no that makes sense yeah I think I'm also maybe a little confused too because I thought when I was first reading this I thought it was like this would be a studio that like people could}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1223, text:  come to if they wanted to to like record or like is this something that's gonna be like open to the}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1228, text:  public or is this just like we we have this for 12 months and this is where the workshops are being}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1235, text:  hosted and that's when people go there or is this like open to the public like how does that work}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1244, text:  yeah we were thinking this community of course you're sorry Derek go ahead}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1251, text:  no I cut you off last time you this is yours I mean it's there's a combination of it this is}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1258, text:  you know at the heart a recording studio that produces incredible content it will change}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1269, text:  the world but you know it is favorable and geared towards nounish people and those teachings}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1279, text:  yeah we just want to see the Mike Good album get produced here exactly that's why}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1283, text:  this is I'm just seeing the comments this studio is for Mike Good to come to Los Angeles and}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1288, text:  finally get produced but no it has the ability to be used in the public it's definitely a curated}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1299, text:  space I mean it you have some very high profile people working in this world it is a very secure}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1309, text:  campus so you know part of the five C's of the park is creation you know curation collection}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1319, text:  we're definitely leaning into some curation here and some some of the community at heart first}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1326, text:  to then reach bigger with curiosity and you know great coffee I mean I'm trying to get Josh Fisher}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1335, text:  yeah oh I'm just trying to add some utility for the uh token holders you

their way to}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1364, text:  their first noun like like so you dicks you've been doing work for so long and}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1369, text:  congratulations for you know having your own noun now as well like we want to help tell those}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1375, text:  stories you know the park alone has helped five noun sales this year you know through our}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1383, text:  collective 11 24 now and some of algae tailors you know and different nouns are the parked out}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1390, text:  members purchasing nouns like we we do want to meet people where they're at but also can}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1395, text:  go deeper with them and help teach why governance is important so}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1402, text:  a lot can happen in a year and we want to make a big impact with that year}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1411, text:  sorry I'm reading comments at the same time it's hard for me to talk and read},

know how effective a studio like this can be and like between just the people}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1430, text:  that I know in nouns and that I know we all have relationships with this studio will be used in}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1438, text:  like really really good interesting ways and a lot of great songs will come from this and I think}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1443, text:  tons of social media opportunities are going to happen inside this space so I see it as just like}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1450, text:  a huge win for this community in terms of having an impact on music because one of the challenges}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1456, text:  for me with music props has always been like the difference between music and visual props is that}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1463, text:  sometimes it's unclear where the music came from or started but in this space you're going to have}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1471, text:  like the encouragement to share images and there's going to be like tons of content film there and}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1478, text:  then artists are going to be able to use it in a way that like creates that real affinity so}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1483, text:  like something like a Red Bull like that program is like legendary in the music industry like}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1488, text:  artists all over the like everyone knows about the Red Bull music studio if you're in the music}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1493, text:  industry and like everyone knows like how important that was for certain things like you know a lot of}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1500, text:  electronic music was created there and given an opportunity to have like those facilities like}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1505, text:  really do help people's careers and they circle back and they remember that stuff so to me this}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1511, text:  is just like a really interesting and cool opportunity and you know if it happens I'm}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1517, text:  really excited to just like put effort into it because it'll be fun.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1524, text:  Yeah I do have another question too just for the transaction right now it's currently just like a lump sum but since}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1530, text:  this is going to be like a year-long proposal like could it be a stream instead I think that}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1538, text:  that would probably help like comfort a lot of DAO members. Definitely could be a stream}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1545, text:  needed like a little heavier on the front side just to make sure everything's good with build}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1555, text:  out and you know the the carting of gear. Essentially we're bringing Pat Olguin, I don't}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1563, text:  know if it's clear in there, Pat Olguin is a park member somebody we've been making records with for}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1569, text:  20 years he has over you know $750,000 worth of gear that he wants to bring into this space}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1577, text:  and you know he worked on Elephunk, all the Cake Records, E40 just like a legend so it's you know}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1586, text:  getting that gear into this space is like a big lift so maybe there's like a percentage of you know}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1598, text:  bigger up front and then the rest streamed yeah open to that scenario as well but it is a bigger}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1605, text:  it's probably it'd probably be like 300 uh up front to be able to execute the build and do}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1612, text:  the move and uh finish some furniture and stuff so I don't know if that's helpful did I cut off}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1623, text:  hello got you okay sorry my ears went silent sorry today she has a call like okay}]}

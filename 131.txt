{segments: [{speaker: spk_0, start: 0, text:  about it so that people have more of an idea of like what it is.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 6, text:  Yeah definitely.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 9, text:  Okay, yeah you wanna go through that or we can wait like maybe two}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 14, text:  more minutes and get more people in here.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 18, text:  Everything is best.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 21, text:  Your choice, yeah let's give it like one more minute we'll get some more}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 24, text:  people in here.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 27, text:  There's a gap. Hey guys, so I know that there's a}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 32, text:  hierarchy of things to talk about which I fully respect.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 35, text:  I just wonder if when it comes, I posed a while back for}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 39, text:  a couple days ago for speaking about the candidate proposal update that we have}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 43, text:  just to more just to shoot the shit with people}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 45, text:  and get people's ideas on it as well as just like to}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 47, text:  shill it I guess. But it's 10 p.m here, 10 30, 10 p.m here and so}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 54, text:  I don't mind waiting of course but if we do the candidates could I put our}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 58, text:  candidate proposal to the top of that list maybe?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 62, text:  Yeah of course not a problem. Yeah we just usually go through the}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 65, text:  on-chain active ones first then we move to candidates.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 68, text:  But yeah yours can definitely be the first candidate no problem.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 72, text:  Thank you so much. Yeah of course. GM by the way, Jake}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 76, text:  while we're stalling for whiz two I'm waiting to put the}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 80, text:  nouns based candidate on chain just hoping that gas will drop}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 83, text:  a little bit during this call. So it will be on chain soon heads up.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 90, text:  Hey Willie good to speak to you again. Good to see you again.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 93, text:  Perfect okay yeah let's get started. Whiz if you want to kick it off}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 98, text:  and you're going to be talking about wand}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 101, text:  which was the proposal that you had off. Correct yeah so I could start with like}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 107, text:  a quick like you know one minute just general direction}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 110, text:  that I'm moving in so I think people have an idea}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 114, text:  of like what I'm doing. So a lot of this started because}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 118, text:  a lot of crypto especially DAOs they're like this giant}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 122, text:  like Rube Goldberg machines. If you don't know what a Rube Goldberg machine}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 126, text:  I recommend googling it it's pretty funny it's like one of those videos where}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 129, text:  like people drop a marble and it does all this crazy stuff.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 133, text:  Yeah and I don't think we're going to be able to grow nouns}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 137, text:  or like just DAO governance in general without abstracting a lot of that}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 141, text:  complexity away. And I don't think the complexity is}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 145, text:  going away either we kind of need it for decentralization}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 150, text:  and so I think in a lot of ways we need to reimagine what governance kind of}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 154, text:  looks like or at least find ways to get leverage}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 157, text:  out of it that people aren't willing to do. And I}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 161, text:  think AI models are just going to be a huge part of it.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 164, text:  It's like new technology it's an obvious fit for governance}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 169, text:  and so started experimenting you know what}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 173, text:  what's the most important like the foundational behavior}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 176, text:  everybody does it's voting and so if we can get}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 180, text:  like LLMs to understand governance really well}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 183, text:  and LLMs to understand the people in our community really well}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 192, text:  then we can easily onboard new people and we can govern}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 195, text:  ourselves scale the governance as nouns grows into the future.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 202, text:  Yeah so I know that's pretty broad but from there}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 210, text:  I want to know if anybody has any questions.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 214, text:  I have a question. For instance like one of the comments was}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 225, text:  like Brennan just didn't really seem too keen on it}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 229, text:  would there be a way for someone to like opt out of their profile being}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 235, text:  included in this? Yeah I mean right now inference is}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 241, text:  really expensive so I'm only doing vote predictions for}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 246, text:  like a subset of the community it's really like the}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 250, text:  most active voters and the people with the most data that I}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 254, text:  can get so like let's say you've been voting with Reason for a while}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 257, text:  or you have like high voting weight and you're active.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 261, text:  I don't mind providing a way like I don't mind removing Brennan if he really}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 265, text:  doesn't like it but I think}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 269, text:  also his engagement shows that there's like value there in some kind of way.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 274, text:  So I'm thinking of ways like the prototype that there's now}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 279, text:  that that's out there now it's really just an example like this is actually}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 282, text:  possible like it's not fake right I think a lot of people are}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 286, text:  skeptical about like AI in general but I think if}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 291, text:  you like go and look at you know some of the sentiment that you}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 294, text:  could like get from Wanda ready like there's already a lot of value}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 299, text:  there and one thing that happened yesterday or}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 302, text:  or like two days ago I don't know if Natty's here but Natty}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 306, text:  opened a prop to add a new head}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 310, text:  to NAMs and he like actually had like a really positive}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 317, text:  experience seeing that feedback seeing like ways that he could make his}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 322, text:  prop better that's based off of like real governance data.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 329, text:  And I think probably the easiest way for us to scale}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 333, text:  and to actually make NAMs successful is to get more people to join us}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 337, text:  more people to open proposals which just lead to}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 340, text:  to more funding and more ideas to fund right}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 348, text:  and so really my main focus was with wand part of why I'm going to come}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 355, text:  back is because I think I need more detail and like the initial steps}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 358, text:  of what I'm going to take so I'm going to add those}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 362, text:  and kind of adjust the funding so people don't feel like}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 365, text:  it's like this really risky investment or anything like that.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 373, text:  Sorry I'm just trying to check I'm getting notifications I'm trying to}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 377, text:  check the chat at the same time. Oh no worries. Also I was wondering}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 383, text:  like I work in AI now so I think it's like very interesting and I do see it}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 387, text:  kind of like as the future some people could also feel that it}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 391, text:  kind of like takes out the human element but if you're trying to kind of like}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 395, text:  automate things I could see it one thing I think would be beneficial}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 399, text:  is that no AI model is going to be perfect}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 403, text:  right so would there be a way for instance}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 406, text:  with like the lowering the threshold or like the}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 410, text:  the duna prop right if you you look at the feedback or something it}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 414, text:  says that like 4156 is voting you know for lowering the threshold or}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 418, text:  something like that it's like well clearly that's that's a miss right}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 422, text:  would there be a way for someone to go into their profile quick}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 426, text:  and if a new prop comes up and it does give feedback}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 429, text:  that's completely opposite of like what they would}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 433, text:  want to choose maybe for that particular reason}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 436, text:  like could I go in and just change to opt to like a different response like if}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 442, text:  it's saying I'm for this prop and it's like no no I'm against it}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 446, text:  because I do agree that the feedback is valuable but it's like I wouldn't want}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 450, text:  someone to see feedback from me saying for when I'm actually against it but I}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 455, text:  would like some feedback for them still maybe of something that I would say to}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 460, text:  them if that makes sense sure so maybe I can}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 464, text:  give you um kind of like some details of what I'm}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 468, text:  thinking about like what a v1 of one looks like}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 470, text:  like I don't think the best use case for wand is to go to a page}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 474, text:  and just see overall sentiment I think really where you want to hit}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 479, text:  people and probably where they're most comfortable}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 482, text:  is where they're writing a prop so for instance}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 485, text:  like one of the reasons why we don't like there's a lot of reservation to}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 491, text:  like going on chain or opening a prop with nouns is that you}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 495, text:  don't know what kind of response you're going to}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 497, text:  get you don't know if you're going to get completely destroyed}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 500, text:  you don't know if you're going to get all this negative feedback you don't}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 502, text:  know if it's going to be positive and so hitting like prospective}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 507, text:  members before then with like actually really valuable feedback on the prop}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 512, text:  I think would like dramatically increase the amount of inbound we get}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 517, text:  um so one thing I would say is like I think a lot of these}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 523, text:  like simulated votes are kind of going to be more on like}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 528, text:  the back end and the user will know they're like automated}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 532, text:  um the second piece of that is uh I very much expect uh}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 538, text:  and it's probably going to be sooner than later like I wanna I want you to be}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 542, text:  able to have a profile maybe connect your wallet and then you}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 544, text:  could say like okay I'm 41 and like here's more}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 549, text:  information that I haven't leaked on chain}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 553, text:  that I think this model should know about when I vote}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 557, text:  and I would also dramatically increase like kind of like}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 560, text:  individual votes like accuracy on proposals}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 565, text:  um for instance like let's say 40 would say stuff like I don't know I}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 571, text:  really want to get the duna like I think the duna is the best way to}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 574, text:  move forward with the dow and I don't think they should like lower}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 577, text:  the threshold none of his votes would have really came out the wrong way}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 581, text:  um the thing is I'm also limited by the amount of information I have about}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 585, text:  41 that's on chain and then like the third point I would make against that}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 591, text:  is uh we all know lom's hallucinate I think they're getting better}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 598, text:  uh dramatically like very fast and so I think a lot of these problems}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 603, text:  will be fixed in the future um but also I wouldn't take like the}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 610, text:  individual vote as like this is the truth really what}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 614, text:  you're doing it's like kind of like a wisdom of crowds kind of thing}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 618, text:  you have like data from a whole bunch of different people}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 622, text:  that you can get feedback from and like if you put it all together}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 625, text:  generally right so that's how I think about it it's more}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 630, text:  of like crowd wisdom versus like this is exactly how 41}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 633, text:  people's about it yeah that makes sense}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 638, text:  and and oh yeah there's more people thinking it's real yeah that's a problem}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 643, text:  um like right now I'm thinking about like what's the cleanest way to show}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 647, text:  that this is like ai stuff and not like people's real}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 651, text:  votes but it's good to know that we've passed}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 654, text:  the turn test yeah we were all trolling uh mike good}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 659, text:  and um and lils I I thought it was real to be}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 663, text:  honest I guess I just like wasn't paying attention to the troll}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 668, text:  I was showing how good it's I was like wait a minute when did I say that I}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 672, text:  never said anything like that so it was it definitely}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 676, text:  confused me for a second and then I realized what was what it}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 680, text:  was um was I do think this is a is a cool}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 684, text:  implementation it's sort of like the next step of where nouns ai left off}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 688, text:  so I do think this experiment is worthwhile}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 692, text:  but I agree with a lot of the um feedback here so}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 696, text:  how how are you gonna like what changes are you thinking of making to the prop}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 700, text:  if you if you bring it back um yeah so so one thing is}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 708, text:  I think it's going to be useful for me to reduce the scope a little bit}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 713, text:  um and reduce the ask a little bit uh that way}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 716, text:  like people can kind of see the progress over the next couple of months}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 720, text:  um and then I'm gonna be I'm gonna detail some of the}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 729, text:  specific features I planned on building over the next like quarter as well}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 735, text:  um that way I think you know with this conversation and like that information}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 741, text:  people like it wouldn't feel so general um}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 748, text:  and if you have any other advice that would be great}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 751, text:  I think that's helpful I think um I think we needed a little bit more of a}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 755, text:  smaller mvp like a little bit more than what}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 758, text:  you've already done but obviously like not the full scope yet}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 763, text:  I think that'll bring people along a little better}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 766, text:  to see where what direction you're going in so I think I would definitely be in}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 770, text:  favor of that yeah and like another thing I would say}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 774, text:  is um like building building with this kind}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 779, text:  of technology is definitely um}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 784, text:  a very involved thing like I know when you go to the website like}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 788, text:  okay cool you just see the bullets like whatever there's a lot of stuff}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 792, text:  happening in the background so a lot of like the engineering effort}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 795, text:  um I need to do is like around these models}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 799, text:  around like gathering data and synthesizing data}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 803, text:  around like like more uh like cutting edge recent like}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 809, text:  techniques on like dealing with this type of stuff}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 814, text:  um like to give you an example like I'm always reading}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 817, text:  like academic papers I'm like okay you can squeeze performance}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 822, text:  out of these things uh with like you know}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 828, text:  all these crazy techniques and and and it's always in flux and I think}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 832, text:  like that's always going to be a big part of this}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 836, text:  um and then also building the product on the other side as well}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 840, text:  so it kind of like goes hand in hand so another thing is like I don't hold for}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 845, text:  you to um Wiz I would love to see you share some of what you're reading and}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 849, text:  in what kind of research you're taking in because I think that would be useful}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 852, text:  like just interesting to other people too so even if you're yeah}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 855, text:  I don't mind dropping stuff on like I just was looking at I thought that was}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 859, text:  really cool when Nouns.ai did that in their discord}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 861, text:  I thought it was super helpful so I'd love to see that too that'd be cool}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 866, text:  I have got a very poor reception on dropping out academic papers on warp}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 870, text:  cast but I will do that just for you}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 875, text:  thank you yeah work is kind of like not a fair}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 878, text:  no yeah I've never seen I don't think I've seen you um put}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 885, text:  anything out there but I I think it would actually be received}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 888, text:  pretty well even if you drop you could there's also an AI channel you could}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 891, text:  drop it in so yeah yeah I'm also interested in a}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 894, text:  lot of like governance stuff like game theoretic like}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 897, text:  academic research um when we had the Nouns.ai protocol}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 902, text:  stuff going on I dropped some stuff in there and it's}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 905, text:  I think when people see like crazy symbols on in a pdf it's kind of like}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 909, text:  okay like there's more interesting content}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 916, text:  yeah I'm excited to see uh to see their the revision}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 919, text:  um definitely feel free if you put it up as a candidate first}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 923, text:  um you can come in and then even next week if you plan on going up that}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 928, text:  quick um yeah you could you could come back in}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 931, text:  here and then you could um like re-pitch it during the}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 934, text:  candidate phase uh and get more feedback if you'd like}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 937, text:  as well}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 940, text:  um do you think that's ideal I mean I'd rather make the iterations and go}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 945, text:  um yeah whatever whatever you think um I mean you could}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 949, text:  just take in feedback um and you know people can message you and chat and then}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 953, text:  you could just go directly back on chain yeah whatever}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 956, text:  whatever you think is is best yeah I would also say like while I'm}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 959, text:  here if anybody has any questions like I'm}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 962, text:  super open to answering anything I can try to}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 966, text:  see if there's anything in this chat}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 972, text:  yeah we have um oh Mike did you plan on talking about}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 977, text:  your proposal I know that you're like at work because it's during the day}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 992, text:  I'm free for a couple minutes if you guys want me to for sure okay um Wiz are you planning on staying on the call just so that way we can get the first um all of the active proposals done in the}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 996, text:  first hour and then we can move back on to kind of}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 999, text:  more of like candidate feedback type discussion yeah okay}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1005, text:  perfect awesome okay Mike um yeah if you want to kick it off about your proposal}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1009, text:  so voting voting closes uh the 29th and you currently have}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1016, text:  25 4 6 again three abstain so it looks pretty confidently like}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1022, text:  you're getting the nouns of vote which is great}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1024, text:  but yeah people still have nouns that they can vote with so yeah if you want}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1027, text:  to just kind of give a high level overview of like what your}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1035, text:  proposal is and if anyone has any questions for sure for sure thanks guys appreciate everybody's like early support and}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1039, text:  everything especially before coming here to like speak about it or}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1042, text:  chat with some of you guys about it um I feel like it's pretty}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1046, text:  straightforward uh nouns dot world it's basically}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1050, text:  a one-stop shop directory and completed proposal blog um it}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1057, text:  originally started just as me wanting to write a blog that kind of like}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1062, text:  talked about our finished projects things that are like}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1065, text:  completely finished and grouping those props together not just like}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1069, text:  linking out to one of the props that um you know involved the 3d printed fashion}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1075, text:  line but grouping them all together and writing}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1078, text:  like a concise piece about like everything that was done by dennett with}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1082, text:  her 3d fashion line which involved like I think it was four}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1085, text:  or five proposals um so yeah just kind of like compiling}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1089, text:  all of that info and creating like a resource that we}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1093, text:  could use and share as a community um started to realize this was an issue}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1098, text:  when people like noun 40 were sharing like lists on twitter}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1102, text:  they're just like listing every project and trying to find a link to each one}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1105, text:  for people as they like argue about all the good nouns is done}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1109, text:  in the world and and realize that like we just don't have this yet you know}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1112, text:  um we don't have like a blog and we don't have a resource center that's kind}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1116, text:  of like combined that doesn't actually tie into any}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1119, text:  tech or anything and just links out to other people's tech}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1123, text:  so yeah that's kind of what I created here}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1126, text:  um started it the the resource page on nouns.world if you scroll down is like}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1132, text:  basically all there there's still a few things missing and}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1135, text:  obviously as new tools uh get built and released we'll be adding them}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1139, text:  as tools get sunset or uh depreciated we'll}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1143, text:  we'll remove them um and then the second page is the explorer}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1148, text:  and that's going to be where we house like these completed blog posts and}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1152, text:  stuff like that um so I have the first three posts up}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1156, text:  uh for the nouns frog the 3d printed fashion line}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1160, text:  um and the rose bowl parade um and you could see}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1164, text:  how like the first two props were like multiple proposals combined}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1168, text:  um and yeah put like as much info as I could find around the internet}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1173, text:  um on each um you know all of the media mentions all the videos}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1178, text:  and surprisingly there's like a lot of content out there like if you look at}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1182, text:  just the nouns frog there's a ton of media mentions across like}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1186, text:  different um scientific publications and stuff things that people would have}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1189, text:  probably never even realized or or had found}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1193, text:  um unless somebody kind of went through and did all the digging so yeah}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1196, text:  started to do it it's a lot of manual work um the proposal}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1200, text:  is for 20 eth for six months of working on this but}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1204, text:  as I just kind of clarified with um ben lasco um}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1207, text:  this is just to play catch up mostly this is like to get everything we've}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1213, text:  done and have successfully been completed like onto the page}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1217, text:  um I don't anticipate coming back for additional funds}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1222, text:  after this um that was the concern like is it going to be 20th every six months}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1226, text:  and no it's not um it'll most likely become}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1231, text:  semi self-sustainable quote unquote like I probably}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1235, text:  after after this first six months and after the first like 40 50 blog posts or}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1239, text:  so I'll probably uh you know switch how I do}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1243, text:  things maybe even open it up for the community to like submit pr's and}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1247, text:  their own posts and stuff like that but this initial run is going to be like}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1251, text:  to get a good basis of content up on the site}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1254, text:  um and get as much as possible um whiz thanks for the suggestion also}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1260, text:  a couple weeks ago on like getting aggregate like}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1263, text:  some sort of like a historic article database}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1267, text:  um I definitely want to work on that like there's a lot of content written by}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1271, text:  the founders and by other people about the full or from the foundation}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1276, text:  all these things that I definitely want to have like linked out from there also}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1279, text:  and have it be like a pretty concise and complete resource um}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1284, text:  and then yeah in the directory section as well I'm also}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1288, text:  going to be writing some like other blog posts and stuff like on how to get}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1291, text:  started in nouns like I did one a couple weeks ago which was like uh six}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1295, text:  ways you could get started in nouns without owning a noun for example}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1298, text:  um so like as things like that kind of surface and and like we realize}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1302, text:  uh people need further explainers on things or like}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1306, text:  there's like an information gap on something I'll be like adding those}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1309, text:  things in and open for suggestions from the community}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1312, text:  um so yeah thank you to everybody who's already hit me up and given suggestions}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1316, text:  on things to remove from the directory or add into there um things you like}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1320, text:  about the post things you don't um definitely hear the feedback on the}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1324, text:  design um this is just like a v1 of the design}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1328, text:  can certainly fix this up and make it look a little bit more aesthetic for}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1331, text:  everybody um some people like it some people kind}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1334, text:  of don't so I hear that totally heard um and yeah if you guys have}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1343, text:  any feedback or questions let me know Mike this thing is amazing I was curious about}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1346, text:  um like SEO and like driving traffic to the site do you have any plans on on}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1351, text:  that I'm assuming they'll be like all the SEO setup and stuff but is that}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1358, text:  something that you are familiar with and do I have in the past I do a lot of SEO and content marketing for my}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1363, text:  my day job um for this I wasn't planning on focusing on SEO}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1368, text:  it was more for just like organic shares and as people}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1372, text:  are looking for resources on nouns but yeah I mean}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1376, text:  that was a suggestion from someone else um I think pipe even mentioned}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1380, text:  um further tagging a lot of my articles and stuff and}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1383, text:  have it all just better responsive for SEO so}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1386, text:  yeah I could dig in there um and try to try to}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1394, text:  incorporate that a little bit more um then this is like essentially it's like the website but it's a lot of this}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1398, text:  is like the research and organization of everything}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1402, text:  not exactly like the promotion of it's just like putting it all in one place}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1406, text:  and then we'll figure out how to continue to expose it and it'll}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1410, text:  be obviously a great tool when somebody's like hey what is now}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1420, text:  done like I can just say go to this site yep exactly and we've run into like a lot of people looking for more info on nouns like in}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1422, text:  little nouns for example um and there's just like not one resource}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1426, text:  to send them to so yeah um but with that said}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1431, text:  I do want to like try to link up with like different communities}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1435, text:  different newsletters different people hosting spaces and try to get them to}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1439, text:  all help promote this for sure um am I gonna go like run ads for}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1444, text:  nouns dot world on twitter and try to attract like}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1447, text:  other people in probably not um so yeah it is more about getting all}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1452, text:  the content in one place and having a resource for}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1456, text:  when it's needed for our friends for our family for when we're out at an event}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1460, text:  and we want to send somebody to a one-stop shop you know}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1466, text:  yeah and just throwing it out there I think like once we have this and everyone feels really good about this tool I personally}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1470, text:  think it probably would be cool to you know experiment with some of that}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1473, text:  stuff and experiment with driving traffic to the site and trying to}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1477, text:  increase you know the traffic to nouns and the}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1479, text:  awareness so uh personally really support this love it}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1490, text:  thank you for the work thanks so much man appreciate your feedback hey mike just wanted to say I'm like a huge fan of this prop I'm definitely um definitely aligned with}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1495, text:  what I see now needing right now uh the work that we did for map and}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1500, text:  now diverse can hopefully help just as like a big data dump of like a bunch of}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1504, text:  projects that you know still aren't like accessible through}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1508, text:  uh through anywhere and that's a big question that I've had is like}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1511, text:  if somebody's making contributions to sort of the}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1515, text:  you know collective knowledge of nouns and there's no like wiki or directory}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1519, text:  that's up to date to do that you know where might that be}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1521, text:  and I was hopeful that nouns dot wtf would become a place that was more like}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1527, text:  open to collaboration in general but uh if now that world is that then I think}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1532, text:  that's like incredible so great work and I guess I would just ask if you're uh}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1537, text:  open for contributions to the site from other people and teams that are working}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1546, text:  on similar problems yep totally am totally am um as I told somebody earlier um at first I'm just going to try to like get as}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1552, text:  much content up as possible but yeah like open to}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1557, text:  opening this up for prs from everybody um should be pretty simple or just to}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1562, text:  collaborate like if

did have it up as a candidate that you shared with us a few times so yeah}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1721, text:  if you maybe just want to say any like changes you've made from}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1729, text:  the candidacy to now yeah uh i think the only changes that i have made i just added more media uh to show like how far we have gone with}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1734, text:  the project and then um also maybe in the tldr i've}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1738, text:  made it much more clear of what we are what we are doing next}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1743, text:  essentially we are asking for additional funding to}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1748, text:  finish uh finish furnish and paint the noun school}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1752, text:  those of you have been webcast can see some of like}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1755, text:  um the buildings how they look like at this point}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1759, text:  how far we've been able to push the previous proposal}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1762, text:  budgeting uh this proposal was initially funded by}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1766, text:  prop 447 and that today as a question the way it would have been nice to get}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1772, text:  six uh six four seven but anyway six for six is also kind of cool}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1777, text:  for all my numerology people out there uh yeah so we're asking for an additional}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1782, text:  128 000 to finish um and also look at}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1787, text:  uh deploying essentially trying to finalize what we had promised in prop}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1792, text:  447 uh unfortunately we had an under budgeting}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1797, text:  issue and we just tried to squeeze and pull the budget as much as we could for}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1802, text:  the past eight months since january so the story is from january this year}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1807, text:  when this prop passed uh we have we went into}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1811, text:  the approval processes with government so that means we had the architectural}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1815, text:  drawings done we had the the mechanical drawings}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1819, text:  done the structure drawings done that also}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1822, text:  includes plumbing electrical and all that stuff}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1826, text:  and all that was submitted to the government of uganda}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1829, text:  which then gave us approvals to go ahead and construct the school}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1834, text:  then we started construction in april so since april we have been working on}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1840, text:  sites trying to push these buildings one of the things that i wanted to maybe}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1844, text:  highlight is this school is a functional school so}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1849, text:  the the tricky part and i i guess also maybe this is where}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1854, text:  um we ran into}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1859, text:  some budget issues the tricky part was}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1869, text:  pairing with the education of mentors like hey i don't know what the cow}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1873, text:  the cow we call them the chief administrative officer of the district}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1876, text:  when they came to visit us for the first time}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1878, text:  to visit the site and see what they are going to approve see the plans}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1882, text:  she was like one thing is don't interrupt my kids don't interrupt the}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1886, text:  if if you guys are going to move their toilets because some of the}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1889, text:  old toilets when the place where we wanted to build}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1893, text:  so make sure that you build new ones so the only free time we have had to work}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1897, text:  freely on the site is when the kids get their holidays}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1900, text:  right we're just coming off the holidays the}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1905, text:  second term holidays and now it is full-blown}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1907, text:  third term so the next time we have a free}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1911, text:  free time to really push this project very very fast is going to be}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1915, text:  in december starting at early december when the third term closes}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1919, text:  so december and january are going to be like really really busy months that's}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1922, text:  when we'll be doing a lot of the finishing work and the}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1926, text:  finishing work essentially has to do with doing the flooring}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1930, text:  currently they are just on the concrete floor the concrete slab}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1935, text:  that we poured so currently they're using that and that's okay}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1939, text:  but we have to wait for them to get once they get their holidays}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1943, text:  that's when we'll be able to go in and do the flooring do the painting}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1948, text:  you have to paint when they're out when they're not using the buildings because}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1952, text:  some kids you don't know maybe they have allergies to paint something like that}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1955, text:  so for now we're just going to be focusing}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1959, text:  on another section since we have now moved the kids into the}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1963, text:  these new buildings unfinished and they're using them now as classrooms so}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1968, text:  that's really exciting for me it's like at least now we could even get some}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1971, text:  feedback from the kids what do they think about the classrooms and all that}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1975, text:  um yeah so we're now focusing on this other side of the school}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1979, text:  pushing that so that it can also be able to catch up with}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1982, text:  uh with the rest of the buildings have been finished so}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1985, text:  that is what is remaining one of the things that we changed from the}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1989, text:  candidate proposal to now on chain is we had included funding to do like}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1995, text:  announce launch you know um launching ever shout out to derek}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1999, text:  i chose a friday fridays at the park launching this school on fridays at the}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2003, text:  park but uh jamin mike and yes thanks guys for}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2008, text:  you know always giving good feedback and took it into consideration}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2012, text:  and we we removed that from this proposal}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2016, text:  and now we're just focusing on finishing to make sure that}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2020, text:  but we're still going to do the handover that}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2023, text:  last friday of january uh the reason we're doing the handover}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2027, text:  is you know like you it's been a year right}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2031, text:  um some of these projects like we have a school that is being built near our}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2035, text:  school but it's gonna this is the primary school there's}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2037, text:  another secondary school that is being built}]}

spk_0, start: 37, text:  So being able to stretch them out and them not look weird,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 40, text:  right?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 41, text:  I was talking about this on the 9 o'clock}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 43, text:  yesterday is that we had this column that was added later}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 49, text:  on during the construction, because the span}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 52, text:  between the main columns that were supporting the building}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 55, text:  was too big.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 56, text:  And the engineers realized on site,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 58, text:  oh, yeah, this is a little bit too large.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 61, text:  Over time, they will start to sag}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 63, text:  because of the weight of the roof}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 64, text:  and the weight of the bricks.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 66, text:  So we added this extra column that essentially now creates}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 70, text:  the division in the nozzle that creates}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 73, text:  that black and white division in the nozzle.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 74, text:  So that was kind of like a cool, happy accident.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 79, text:  And I'm thinking, I've been talking to them,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 81, text:  I'm like, hey, what could we do to make sure}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 84, text:  that maybe one side looks like the black side}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 88, text:  and then one side looks like the white side?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 91, text:  But anyway, we'll see what we'll be able to make it up.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 93, text:  But for now, the buildings do have the noggles on them.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 98, text:  And for the buildings that have not yet gotten their noggles,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 100, text:  at least we do have those materials ready.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 102, text:  So once we are into this three months, October, November,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 106, text:  December building phase, all that will be coming up.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 109, text:  So we expect that by January,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 114, text:  when the kids go for their holidays,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 117, text:  we'll do the final clearance.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 119, text:  Like all the old buildings will be put down.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 121, text:  There's, I think, only two old buildings that have been left}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 125, text:  and they were left for the sake of not interfering}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 128, text:  with the school curriculum, with the school plans.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 131, text:  So once the holidays come,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 133, text:  all these buildings will be ready}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 135, text:  and we'll get all these buildings down}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 138, text:  and finally we'll be able to see this,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 142, text:  the array of the noggles across all the buildings.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 145, text:  And I think that I think one of the pain}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 150, text:  when I was trying to achieve-}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 154, text:  Is it just me or is Davin cutting out really bad?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 157, text:  I don't know if it's just me though.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 159, text:  Sorry.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 162, text:  Yeah, I just wanna see, is anyone else hearing that}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 164, text:  or could it possibly just be me?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 167, text:  But it's like every other word is like cutting out for me.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 170, text:  It's cutting out on my end as well.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 172, text:  Yeah.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 174, text:  Okay.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 182, text:  Okay, well, we can see too.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 184, text:  Does anyone have any questions from what he shared so far?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 188, text:  Questions or comments?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 191, text:  Can you hear me now?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 193, text:  Yes.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 193, text:  Yeah, sorry, I was stuck on my mobile.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 198, text:  Oh, no worries.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 199, text:  Yeah, any questions.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 201, text:  I'm down to ask them and yeah,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 204, text:  pretty looking forward to what we could do.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 208, text:  Yeah, I liked seeing the photos}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 210, text:  that you just recently shared}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 212, text:  of kind of like the noggles across the building.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 214, text:  Definitely like makes it feel like}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 216, text:  it's kind of all coming to life, so to speak.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 220, text:  Mm-hmm.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 223, text:  Yeah, no, it's pretty exciting for me.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 226, text:  I'm gonna be visiting the site, I think this Saturday.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 230, text:  This Saturday, I'm going with the Brazilian team}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 233, text:  that is in Uganda right now, the NARS Brazilian team.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 236, text:  And I wanna get like their live reaction}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 239, text:  because these things are huge}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 241, text:  and it's like a huge ass building.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 243, text:  So I wanna see how they react,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 246, text:  seeing them like from the photos}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 247, text:  and then you get to see it live on the ground.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 250, text:  So it's pretty exciting.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 252, text:  But yeah, we'll be sharing those along with this, yeah.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 260, text:  Okay, perfect.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 261, text:  Does anyone else have any questions}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 263, text:  or comments about this proposal?}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 267, text:  Just give one feel good story of an experience you've had with any of the kids talking about like}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 270, text:  how excitement they are.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 274, text:  Well, that's a very good one.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 276, text:  I remember I was with,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 277, text:  I'd gone with my wife one of these weekends}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 279, text:  and I had walked around the community}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 284, text:  and then these kids stopped me}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 286, text:  and they were kneeling down thanking me for the school.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 290, text:  It was kinda like, oh, I wasn't recording,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 292, text:  so I can't really, but yeah, they knelt down}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 295, text:  and were like, oh, thank you so much}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 296, text:  for doing this for our community.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 297, text:  I was like, oh no, it's not me.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 299, text:  It's just the whole thing called nouns.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 302, text:  And yeah, it was one of those moments}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 305, text:  I realized, oh, sometimes you do something,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 309, text:  I would say, like you don't know the effect}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 314, text:  to have on people, right?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 316, text:  But I was telling Prof the other day}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 319, text:  is that some of these kids don't even have ceilings}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 321, text:  in their homes, but the class at school has a ceiling.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 326, text:  So that changes someone's perspective on life.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 330, text:  Like, oh, me, when I build my house,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 331, text:  I want it to be like my school.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 334, text:  I want this thing in my house, whatever it costs,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 336, text:  just do it because I saw it somewhere.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 339, text:  Yeah, so.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 347, text:  I really hope too that learning that it's like a group of people from around the world who supported this}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 350, text:  and maybe the technology that allowed that to happen}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 354, text:  has some level of positive effect too,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 360, text:  making them more interested in learning about this.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 365, text:  Cool, man, thank you.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 367, text:  Yeah, yeah, one thing I can really talk about}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 369, text:  when we were sort of like coming up with this budget}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 373, text:  of finishing, we were like, okay, you know what?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 376, text:  This is like too much to ask, what can we cut?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 381, text:  I was talking to one of the school administrators}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 386, text:  and was like, hey, you could cut a lot of things,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 390, text:  but try not to cut the electricity part}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 393, text:  because even if you do like in a couple of buildings}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 397, text:  or maybe one or two, and that's why we cut it down}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 399, text:  to like three buildings, that element alone}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 404, text:  will plant the seed of like, hey, we need to teach}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 407, text:  these kids about crypto and for the buildings we have left}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 409, text:  to have the solar electricity in,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 411, text:  it's the administration building, that's like the office,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 413, text:  you know, that's very important.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 415, text:  And then this technology block, right?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 417, text:  Which already has an August, right now they're already}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 419, text:  using it as a normal classroom, but I think after we're done}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 422, text:  with that, that's when we'll bring in the computers,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 426, text:  the library, but just having those computers,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 430, text:  we're choosing to use laptops because of the solar energy,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 437, text:  you cannot, also you cannot have like a huge desktop}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 439, text:  or like a gaming table PC.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 442, text:  But yeah, that's the thing I'm looking forward to,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 444, text:  like I get my weekend where I'm at home, I'm in the village}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 449, text:  and just go down there and be like, hey,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 451, text:  maybe the upper classes of P7, primary seven,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 455, text:  which is like the final class, like, hey, primary seven,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 457, text:  let's have an extra class and just have all of them}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 460, text:  create their wallets, then teach them about crypto}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 465, text:  and like, hey, this is how the school was funded}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 467, text:  and I don't know how the seeds will grow,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 472, text:  you know, I can't really put it handily,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 474, text:  like all these kids will grow up and buy it now,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 477, text:  but I do know it does change someone's perspective.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 482, text:  There's a parent who was telling me,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 483, text:  is like, oh yeah, I'll bring my kids to school}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 486, text:  just because it has computers, you know,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 489, text:  that's the only reason they're bringing their kid}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 491, text:  to the school and that, I don't know,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 495, text:  it was like, I first saw, I think I first saw the computer,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 499, text:  like a computer in like 2000, what, 2004?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 504, text:  Yeah, 2004 and it was like my cousin}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 506, text:  who brought this laptop at home and we used to just,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 509, text:  all I knew was like drag a track}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 512, text:  and put it into the Windows Media Player}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 514, text:  and then it automatically plays, but fast forward,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 520, text:  I now can participate in this global industry}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 523, text:  because of, you know, I'm trying to use my neighbors,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 527, text:  yeah, a kid, 2004, being introduced to the computer}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 531, text:  and back then the computers never even had internet, right?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 534, text:  I created my first Twitter account in 2009, yeah?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 540, text:  Like I think when Twitter was just starting.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 542, text:  So this is like, you do something and it's a seed,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 545, text:  you just don't know what's gonna happen after that.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 548, text:  I mean, my hope is, and that's what I usually say}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 550, text:  whenever I'm at a school is that my hope is}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 553, text:  30 years from now, another kid from the school}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 557, text:  will come out and say, hey, I wanna do something}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 559, text:  for my community, just like how this guy}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 561, text:  did this something for his community.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 563, text:  And then just like how the people who came before us}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 568, text:  also did what they could and we found the school,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 571, text:  we studied in the school and now we're just giving back.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 575, text:  So that chain, it keeps on giving}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 578, text:  as you go along over the years, so.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 582, text:  Yeah, definitely.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 584, text:  Yeah, as I mentioned before,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 587, text:  so this prop is live right now for an ounce of voting.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 590, text:  Voting does close October 1st at 851 a.m. EST.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 595, text:  So plenty of time to vote.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 597, text:  You actually got some more votes coming in during this call.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 602, text:  So you currently have 12 votes for,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 604, text:  zero against, zero abstain.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 607, text:  So yeah, if anyone has any questions or comments,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 610, text:  definitely feel free to message Davin.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 614, text:  I did see that we did just have a new proposal}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 616, text:  go up on chain 10 minutes ago.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 618, text:  So now we do have one more active proposal}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 621, text:  to get through during this last hour.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 625, text:  But yeah, does anyone else have any final questions}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 628, text:  or thoughts for Davin?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 630, text:  If not, you can definitely feel free to message him.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 633, text:  He's definitely responsive.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 638, text:  All right.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 639, text:  Yeah, one thing that maybe just for closing, sorry, Bix,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 643, text:  one thing that did come up was,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 645, text:  could we have this sort of like a language center,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 651, text:  like language training center.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 653, text:  And I remember I was shout out to Hero, I see Hero is here.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 656, text:  We're talking about this, like,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 658, text:  having to introduce something like this at a primary level.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 662, text:  You know, at the primary level,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 663, text:  kids are very receptive to learning new things.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 666, text:  So that's one of the things that, going forward,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 669, text:  and I don't talk a lot about post-construction,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 672, text:  but I do see a lot of amazing things happening}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 675, text:  in this core post-construction.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 677, text:  And yeah, just keep the prop dates coming over the years,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 682, text:  like how we solved the water problem, you know,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 685, text:  how we then maybe added the language school.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 687, text:  And, you know, then we did the tech,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 690, text:  like the tech block past the computers, maybe some,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 694, text:  what I'm hoping is that other partners}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 696, text:  could then come on board, especially after we hand over,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 699, text:  we start to interest other partners,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 701, text:  because I feel many people do appreciate something}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 705, text:  that is already done, and they're kind of like, you know,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 709, text:  knocking it in the park, like that last pass,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 712, text:  and just get into the goal.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 714, text:  That's how we see a lot of partners come on board.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 716, text:  And I'm really excited to what could happen}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 718, text:  post-construction, yeah.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 720, text:  But yeah, thanks guys.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 721, text:  And any questions, just DM me.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 723, text:  Thanks, Bix.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 725, text:  Okay, perfect.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 725, text:  Definitely looking forward to seeing this go on chain.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 729, text:  It is still editable, and voting is still for, you know,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 734, text:  a few more days in Nounsault.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 735, text:  So make sure to get out and vote.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 738, text:  Let's see, do we have Willie in here?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 740, text:  I just saw 10 minutes ago, your prop went up.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 742, text:  So double down on Nounspace V2, prop 647.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 747, text:  647, yep, just trying to keep you on your toes, Bix by it.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 751, text:  But I know this was the last minute, so I'll be quick.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 755, text:  GM, everybody, we're excited to hear y'all's thoughts}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 758, text:  on this V2 version of the prop to double down on Nounspace.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 762, text:  I've got two of my team members here as well,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 764, text:  Reality Crafter and Skateboard.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 766, text:  So I know we've talked quite a bit about this prop.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 769, text:  I hope everyone of y'all has heard about Nounspace}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 771, text:  and given Nounspace a try at this point.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 775, text:  But yeah, we got some great feedback on the first version.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 777, text:  We've incorporated those changes.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 779, text:  We've continued to ship and to grow Nounspace.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 783, text:  So I mainly wanna answer some questions.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 785, text:  I guess I'll spend one minute}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 787, text:  just running through the main changes}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 789, text:  that we made to the prop.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 791, text:  So first and foremost, we decreased the funding request}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 793, text:  from 250K to $200,000.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 796, text:  As part of that, our full-time head count is four.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 798, text:  So myself as a PM and then three rockstar engineers.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 803, text:  We really honed in our goal for this prop}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 806, text:  to focusing on showing early validation}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 809, text:  and signs of being on the right track}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 811, text:  towards product market fit}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 812, text:  by onboarding at least 10 communities}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 815, text:  who are using Nounspace as their primary hub.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 818, text:  These are Web3 communities.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 819, text:  So of course, Nounish communities,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 821, text:  but not only Nounish communities.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 823, text:  From day one, we felt that the real opportunity here}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 826, text:  is for Nouns to not only build a far caster client}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 828, text:  that's awesome and great for all the Nounish communities}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 830, text:  and Nouners, but all Web3 communities.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 833, text:  And we think Web3 communities are a perfect fit}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 836, text:  for our initial beachhead market}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 838, text:  because not only are we very familiar with them}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 841, text:  and connected to them, not only on the team side}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 845, text:  but with our experience working in crypto}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 846, text:  for seven plus years and contributing to multiple DAOs,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 851, text:  launching DAOs, growing and helping to decentralize DAOs,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 855, text:  but also with the Nouns community.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 856, text:  We think it's just a really technically unfair advantage}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 859, text:  that we could, yeah, basically have}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 863, text:  the whole entire community of Nouns}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 864, text:  who's connected throughout Web3}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 868, text:  to so many different communities}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 870, text:  and even beyond Web3 to be able to then rally around}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 873, text:  a product for Web3 communities that are using far caster,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 878, text:  we think is just like a great,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 879, text:  a blend of experience and skills and networks.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 883, text:  So really a special opportunity here.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 885, text:  And yeah, kind of like Wiz was saying earlier,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 888, text:  these Web3 communities are particularly siloed}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 891, text:  and fragmented.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 893, text:  They have a lot of their content and functionality}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 896, text:  spread across multiple different venues,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 898, text:  their website, their app,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 900, text:  their social presences, of course,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 902, text:  but their governance as well,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 903, text:  their forum, if they have an NFT,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 905, text:  it can be on a marketplace,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 906, text:  or if they have a token,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 907, text:  it can be on DEXs or other DeFi protocols,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 909, text:  and there's market data for it.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 911, text:  And so this stuff is just spread out}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 913, text:  in so many different places.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 914, text:  And right now, the best options for them}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 916, text:  to bring it all together to build something new.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 918, text:  And that's why we see so many DAOs}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 919, text:  that have these link trees}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 921, text:  with a bunch of different things}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 922, text:  or a page on their site that has links to everything,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 925, text:  but it's not integrated with social.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 926, text:  And our whole thesis is that social is where it makes sense}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 929, text:  to bring all of this together.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 931, text:  And by enabling these Web3 communities}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 934, text:  to do that on social,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 934, text:  while also really honing in on the Web3 communities}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 937, text:  and their needs that are not currently being met}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 939, text:  by X or WarpCast or other social apps,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 942, text:  we can really build the best experience for them,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 945, text:  the best way for them to share the content,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 947, text:  the vibes and the functionality}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 948, text:  that they want with their audience.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 950, text:  And if we can get the Web3 communities on board,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 952, text:  we can make it very compelling}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 954, text:  and in their best self-interest}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 955, text:  to onboard their community members.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 957, text:  And that we think is the best way}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 958, text:  to get that initial user base,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 960, text:  which we can then use to attract developers}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 961, text:  to start building whatever kind of fidgets they can imagine.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 964, text:  And this is where we think the big opportunity is.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 967, text:  We're seeing huge trends in customization}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 969, text:  and many apps coming to social.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 971, text:  And Nounspace is fortunate}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 972, text:  to be like six months ahead of that curve.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 974, text:  We saw where the fuck was going}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 976, text:  and we've been building towards this}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 977, text:  and have a super solid foundation in place}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 980, text:  that's built exactly for this.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 982, text:  So clarified our vision, our mission, our target user,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 986, text:  our go-to-market strategy.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 987, text:  We added some usage metrics}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 989, text:  and you can check out the full public dashboard}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 991, text:  of Nounspace usage to see how it's growing}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 994, text:  and how consistent it's been.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 996, text:  We also added some more info on space.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 998, text:  Big spite I added that disclaimer for you}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 999, text:  to make it clear that Noun supporting Nounspace's development}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1002, text:  does not equate to an endorsement of the space token.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1005, text:  And that also added some information on Nounspace DAO,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1008, text:  which a really solid DAO stack.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1010, text:  We've got a solid community that's growing}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1012, text:  and starting to make proposals and vote on them,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1016, text:  which is awesome to see.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1018, text:  And yeah, just added a lot of information}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1022, text:  to the prop.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1022, text:  We also updated the appendix.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1025, text:  So we moved a lot of this stuff on what we have done so far,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1027, text:  which is quite a bit down to the appendix.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1029, text:  So you can check that out}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1031, text:  and see what this team is capable of doing}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1033, text:  just with 100K.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1034, text:  And then I hope that once you guys see all this,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1036, text:  you'll be excited to see what the team can do with 200K.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1040, text:  So I'll stop there.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1041, text:  I'll see if anyone else has any questions they wanna ask.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1044, text:  I have a question.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1051, text:  This is Wiz.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1055, text:  What is it that you think brings people to Nounspace}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1061, text:  versus something like Orpaz?}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1066, text:  Yeah, so again, our thesis is that there's all this content}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1070, text:  and really functionality that already exists}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1072, text:  on the online universe.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1073, text:  We think the online universe is bigger}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1075, text:  than what's currently on social}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1077, text:  and on Warpcast or social right now,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1078, text:  you can basically post, you can like, you can comment,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1082, text:  you can use frames as long as you see the frame in a feed}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1085, text:  or it's pinned on someone's page, but that's about it.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1088, text:  And we think that obviously the digital universe}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1091, text:  is so much greater than that}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1092, text:  and these communities have so much more to share.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1094, text:  And right now that's why you see communities, creators,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1098, text:  they post something.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1100, text:  If they've created something outside of social,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1102, text:  the best thing they can do is post it on social,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1104, text:  hope their audience sees that in their feed}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1106, text:  and then hopes that their audience}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1108, text:  then leaves the social app to go check it out.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1110, text:  And we're just making that significantly easier.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1112, text:  We're bringing it right into social}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1114, text:  so that they don't have to leave}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1115, text:  and so that communities can share all this great stuff}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1117, text:  that they're doing right on their page}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1120, text:  when people come to visit it.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1121, text:  And then users for the communities}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1123, text:  in the content functionality that matter to them,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1125, text:  they can also add these mini apps to their home base.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1128, text:  So it's right accessible with themes, fitters and tabs,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1132, text:  these core features that we've started with}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1134, text:  really give just like complete customizability}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1136, text:  and control to communities to share the content functionality}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1139, text:  and vibes they want and for users,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1142, text:  especially these power users of web3}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1143, text:  to basically access all the stuff}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1145, text:  that's important to them in one place.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1149, text:  Okay, so do you see like in the future now in space}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1154, text:  evolving like a global feed of like user activity}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1159, text:  and stuff like that?}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1160, text:  Or do you see it more as like,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1164, text:  you mentioned Linktree earlier, like this is our page,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1169, text:  this is where we store like all of the important things}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1172, text:  to us and this is where you can like reach out to us}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1175, text:  and stuff like that.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1177, text:  Yeah, I saw Reality Craft friend muted}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1179, text:  so I'd love to hear his answer on this.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1183, text:  Yeah, basically we like all these web3 communities}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1185, text:  are unique and so we want to give them the tools}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1188, text:  to bring all of that into social}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1190, text:  and to also bring social into everything else}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1192, text:  that they're creating.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1196, text:  Does that answer your question, Wiz and Reality Crafter,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1199, text:  if you have something else to add there, please jump in.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1202, text:  Yeah, I just,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1204, text:  having like your group's website integrated}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1209, text:  with like a social platform helps with people}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1212, text:  finding your group,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1214, text:  it helps some people learning about that group,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1216, text:  basically it gives you like access}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1220, text:  to that broader like social world.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1224, text:  That's part of the reason why we had this evolution}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1227, text:  from like web one to web two,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1232, text:  personal blogs were like something that people really loved}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1235, text:  but they didn't have the discoverability}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1237, text:  of like the social media networks}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1239, text:  and so almost everyone switched over}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1241, text:  to using these platforms that really locked down}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1243, text:  your ability to like how you present your information,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1246, text:  your content and where information like flows}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1251, text:  and we have like the opportunity here}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1253, text:  with like decentralized social networks}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1256, text:  to bring back the ability for creators}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1258, text:  to build their own platforms}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1260, text:  but still be plugged directly into that social network.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1265, text:  So I mean, we see that like right now our target}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1268, text:  is gonna be web3 audiences}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1269, text:  but a ton of like local groups in IRL}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1276, text:  use like Facebook groups right now to coordinate}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1278, text:  and to like to set up like meetings}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1280, text:  and to basically keep the group all on the same page}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1282, text:  but Facebook has not invested in Facebook groups in ages,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1286, text:  like the platform itself is really outdated,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1288, text:  it doesn't have a ton of features,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1290, text:  it's just like the best option that's out there}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1292, text:  that's still plugged into a social network}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1295, text:  and I think like creating a platform for groups}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1299, text:  to like be able to gather together}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1303, text:  and then have ways for other people to get integrated}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1308, text:  and involved in that group like directly on the page}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1311, text:  is gonna be very helpful and definitely like right now}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1316, text:  getting people to click out to a separate site}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1318, text:  from like social media is often like very challenging,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1322, text:  like the click-through rates of someone}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1324, text:  going to someone's profile versus clicking the next link}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1327, text:  like really lower your odds}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1328, text:  to like actually have someone engaged with that site}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1332, text:  so this just kind of brings it all into one place, yeah.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1339, text:  Something else I'll add too, we had this in the proposal}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1341, text:  but we want to, we built this really solid foundation}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1345, text:  so like over the past six months}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1347, text:  we focused on building this core client}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1349, text:  that has the core functionality of WarpCast,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1351, text:  we still have a couple more things to add there}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1353, text:  like channels and like the ability}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1354, text:  just to link to cast inside Nounspace}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1357, text:  but on top of that we built themes, widgets and tabs,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1360, text:  this really solid foundation}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1361, text:  that gives us so much flexibility to build on top of}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1365, text:  and so these, like in the prop we have the concept}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1369, text:  of doing kind of proactive space customization}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1372, text:  so to your point, Wizz, like even before}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1374, text:  these FarCaster users have signed up for Nounspace,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1378, text:  we have the ability to look at their on-chain history}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1380, text:  and show things like their on-chain history}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1382, text:  basically of the transactions they've been doing,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1384, text:  their portfolio, their NFT collection,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1388, text:  their governance participation if they have that}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1390, text:  so basically we can look at on-chain history}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1392, text:  if someone's a member of Nouns, for example,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1394, text:  we see that they hold a noun}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1395, text:  and have participated in governance,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1397, text:  we can show that directly on their space}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1398, text:  even before they've logged in which is kind of a cool way,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1401, text:  like you can see the network effects here}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1403, text:  where every user that joins Nounspace}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1406, text:  makes the network more valuable}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1407, text:  because now there's another customized space}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1409, text:  people can explore}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1410, text:  and we have a pretty awesome opportunity}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1412, text:  to like kickstart those network effects}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1414, text:  and basically like seed the marketplace by one,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1417, text:  all of these FarCaster accounts that already exist}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1420, text:  but two, the social graph data, the on-chain history}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1423, text:  and just a growing number of these rules we can create}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1424, text:  where we can automatically add these fidgets to user spaces}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1428, text:  so that from day one basically even before}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1430, text:  we have critical massive users using Nounspace,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1433, text:  it's already a better experience for people to use}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1435, text:  than just browsing more paths.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1437, text:  We can keep looking at other unique differentiators}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1439, text:  like as channels, this new channel standard comes out,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1442, text:  I think it's a big opportunity for us to one,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1445, text:  add channel support}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1445, text:  because we already have users asking for that}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1447, text:  and we know we need it for web3 communities}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1451, text:  but also build it better than what WarpCast is doing,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1454, text:  look at the functionality that they're not adding}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1456, text:  such as like the ability to apply to join a channel}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1458, text:  that we know is gonna be in demand for a lot of channels}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1461, text:  and people that wanna join channels}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1463, text:  and offer that functionality via Nounspace.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1466, text:  We actually just heard yesterday}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1467, text:  that Seneca is planning to do this for rounds}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1472, text:  instead of building our own separate system for this,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1474, text:  we could potentially build on top of them}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1476, text:  and that's a lot of what we're doing at Nounspace}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1478, text:  rather than trying to build our own interface}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1481, text:  or governance interface,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1482, text:  leveraging the existing things like Nounswap,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1485, text:  like Camp and not trying to just replace those}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1490, text:  but bring all this stuff that already exists together}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1492, text:  and there's just a huge opportunity to do that.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1494, text:  We're surprised nobody's built this yet}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1497, text:  and yeah, we have again a solid foundation,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1500, text:  we know we're not quite there yet,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1502, text:  there's definitely a lot of work we have to do}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1503, text:  to get Nounspace to the point}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1505, text:  where it could be the best tool for these communities}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1508, text:  like the primary hub that they wanna share content}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1510, text:  and functionality with their audiences}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1512, text:  but we think we're on the right track,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1513, text:  we think we've proven that the team can deliver this}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1516, text:  and we have some very positive and encouraging momentum.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1520, text:  If you check the prop,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1521, text:  there's like at least 30 testimonials from people}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1524, text:  who have used Nounspace and love it}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1526, text:  and like it's so rare to see growth in testimonials}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1529, text:  from such an early stage product}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1532, text:  especially one of those ambitious and tricky to build}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1533, text:  as a customizable barcaster client with many apps}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1538, text:  but we hope that we've shown what we can do}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1541, text:  and that we're on the right track}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1542, text:  and that more resources are needed}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1544, text:  to actually make this whole endeavor worthwhile}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1547, text:  and something that can actually deliver}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1548, text:  an RLI to Nounspace or to Nouns.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1552, text:  Yeah and so the team like could not be more committed}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1555, text:  to continuing just to be completely dedicated}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1557, text:  to achieving this mission.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1559, text:  We think it is such a compelling opportunity for Nouns}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1562, text:  and just for the broader web3 ecosystem}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1564, text:  and for our team to make this happen.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1566, text:  So really hope you guys can see that}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1569, text:  and hope that everybody also}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1571, text:  will just give Nounspace a try.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1572, text:  I know that there was some feedback on the first prop}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1574, text:  that like, oh, we haven't tried Nounspace yet.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1576, text:  Well, it's faster to try Nounspace}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1578, text:  and customize your space than read the prop.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1580, text:  So you only had 10 minutes,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1582, text:  hope that you will just give Nounspace a try}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1584, text:  while also keeping in mind that this is just the beginning.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1589, text:  Cool.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1591, text:  Do you have time for one more question?}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1594, text:  I've got time as long as Vix play it and y'all have time.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1597, text:  Yeah, definitely.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1598, text:  Yeah, let's do one more question}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1599, text:  and then we can, we'll cruise on to the candidates phase.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1602, text:  But I mean, this is an active proposal.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1604, text:  So yeah, definitely comments, questions, anything.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1608, text:  I mean, it is editable now, so.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1611, text:  Yeah, no, I think that sounds cool.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1615, text:  Lily, one last thing I was thinking of like,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1619, text:  distribution wise, do you see people using}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1624, text:  this instead of WarpCast}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1625, text:  or pulling them in from WarpCast or something like that?}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1630, text:  Or like as a competitor to channels kind of?}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1638, text:  A hundred percent.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1639, text:  And we know we're not quite there yet.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1640, text:  Like again, until we have the ability, for example,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1643, text:  just to link to Cast inside of Nounspace}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1645, text:  from your notifications or from elsewhere,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1648, text:  until we have support for channels,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1649, text:  we know that we're not yet like a competitive alternative}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1653, text:  to WarpCast.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1654, text:  Also mobile support is something that we know we need}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1657, text:  and we're super excited about it.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1658, text:  If you check out the mock-ups for mobile in the prop,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1661, text:  you'll see pretty slick and something that you could}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1663, text:  imagine yourself using daily.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1666, text:  So yeah, we have some work to do,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1668, text:  but that's certainly the goal.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1669, text:  And yeah, well, I think one of the unique advantages}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1672, text:  that we do have beyond this community of y'all,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1676, text:  of nouns that can support us is the space token.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1679, text:  And WarpCast has made it super clear}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1680, text:  that they're never gonna be doing a token.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1683, text:  And we really believe that the future of social}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1685, text:  should be community owned.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1686, text:  Like our mission is to build the future of social.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1689, text:  We strongly believe that should be community owned.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1692, text:  You need a token to do that.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1693, text:  And our team does have a lot of experience launching tokens,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1696, text:  launching DAOs, and we're using all of that}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1698, text:  and the latest and greatest advancements}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1701, text:  to build the best token we can,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1703, text:  the best governance and utility token.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1705, text:  And we think that's just a huge opportunity}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1707, text:  to be able to bootstrap these network effects}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1709, text:  to attract these early users, communities, and developers}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1712, text:  that we need to make noun space successful.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1715, text:  So we have some plans for that and we have,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1718, text:  they're in the prop, but for sure,}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1720, text:  right now we're just focused on getting}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1721, text:  some initial communities on board using noun space daily}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1724, text:  so that you can really just have a clear focus goal}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1726, text:  that we feel confident we can crush.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1729, text:  But yeah, the sky's the limit.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1730, text:  And definitely we think there's some}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1732, text:  compelling differentiators to WarpCast}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1734, text:  that can help us achieve that.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1739, text:  Thank you.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1740, text:  Thank you for the detailed responses.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 1743, text:  My pleasure. Thanks for the great cues, Wizz.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1747, text:  Sounds good.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1748, text:  Does anyone else have any more comments, questions?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1753, text:  This prop did just go live for voting and nouns.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1756, text:  So it, let's see.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1760, text:  You already have one vote for, zero against, zero abstain.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1765, text:  And it doesn't say how long this one is going for,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1768, text:  but I think that's just because it's so new.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1770, text:  So yeah, voting should still be probably open}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1773, text:  for another three or four days in nouns.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1775, text:  So if anyone has any other questions or comments,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1778, text:  definitely feel free to message Willie.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1782, text:  All the comments and stuff really help}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 1784, text:  before people go on chain.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1785, text:  I got a quick something.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1787, text:  Yeah, of course.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1790, text:  So I love FarCaster.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1793, text:  I kind of hate WarpCast.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1795, text:  There's nothing really out there.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1797, text:  Supercast is okay.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1801, text:  I haven't used Nounspace.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1803, text:  So a lot of this is just more theoretical.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1805, text:  I have logged in, I've made a little bit,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1807, text:  but that was kind of earlier.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1809, text:  I think you've done the update since then.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1812, text:  So I haven't really played around with it since the update.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1816, text:  A couple of questions here.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1819, text:  So you have, most historical media has been successful}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1823, text:  by selling customers' data, right?}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1825, text:  You want to community on things.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1827, text:  So I think exploring the FarCaster}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1831, text:  and what it can provide is a great thing.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1835, text:  And I don't think we really have that going on.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1837, text:  We had that round, and I'm not trying to say}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1839, text:  like you have said,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1840, text:  because I don't necessarily agree with some of the reasoning.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1843, text:  Like we paid 300, so we might as well push forward.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1845, text:  I just think that you could potentially have a direction.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1849, text:  Like it's weird, all of a sudden,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1850, text:  like all these other Myspace wannabe popups,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1852, text:  all of a sudden like started popping up}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1853, text:  and I was like, this is,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1855, text:  it felt like I was in a simulation, to be honest.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1859, text:  It felt like that for us too.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1861, text:  I was like, what the hell is going on?}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1863, text:  I'm like, where are, you know, no offense.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1865, text:  Comment on it and say, have you heard of Myspace?}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1868, text:  Well, I was too taken aback.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1870, text:  I'm like, having like, no offense.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1872, text:  I'm like, we've been kind of mocking the Myspace thing,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1875, text:  you know, just like as a joke, right?}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1878, text:  Privately, not outward.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1880, text:  But yeah, so I think exploring this is worth pursuing.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1888, text:  I think some of the back and forth we've had}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1890, text:  about like the ideas of what I think is missing and needed.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1894, text:  You're, you've always kind of been like,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1897, text:  yeah, we've been thinking about that.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1898, text:  We're like, we're always on the same page roughly, right?}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1902, text:  So I do get that you realize you're not there and all that.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1907, text:  So my first point is,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1909, text:  I think FarCaster is definitely worth exploring.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1913, text:  So I'll put that there.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1915, text:  The second thing though is, so we get you another 200,000.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1919, text:  Let's say everything goes incredibly well}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1922, text:  and you have your space token,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1923, text:  which has a little bit of yield.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1926, text:  When the traditional social media has all been made}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1930, text:  successful and self-sustainable on data selling,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1936, text:  what is your guys' plan?}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1939, text:  I know you have said you're gonna sell widgets}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1941, text:  and stuff like that and people will make widgets}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1943, text:  and that's kind of an income.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1945, text:  I can kind of maybe think,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1946, text:  like I guess I just don't really buy into that}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1948, text:  from my personal point of view.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1951, text:  Is there an idea?}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1952, text:  I guess I'll just let you talk}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1953, text:  instead of kind of throwing ideas out there.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1955, text:  What would be your plan after the $200,000 is exhausted}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1958, text:  or if and when, I mean,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1960, text:  you must be planning for that eventuality.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1963, text:  We have a couple of different revenue directions}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1967, text:  we're gonna pursue.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1969, text:  So one of the ways that we could look at this}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1971, text:  as revenue generation beyond the data and ads approach}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1976, text:  is to look at it more like Squarespace}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1979, text:  as a replacement for website builders}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1981, text:  that companies and organizations will use.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1984, text:  In which case, our plan is to take the tabs on profiles}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1990, text:  and for folks that don't have one of the OG supporters}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1994, text:  or any of the badges, there will be tabs that you pay for}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 1997, text:  on a yearly basis to basically expand the website}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2000, text:  and the functionality.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2002, text:  Like our current price target for that}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2004, text:  is about $3 per tab per year,}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2006, text:  which is pretty competitive}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2008, text:  with other website builders out there.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2011, text:  But then yeah, we want to explore the idea}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2014, text:  of fidgets as an app store and as something}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2018, text:  where people can start to monetize the fidgets}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2024, text:  that they're making.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2024, text:  And then, yeah, Willie's sharing}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2027, text:  this section on sustainability there.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2030, text:  Yeah, we're basically hoping that that will pan out.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2033, text:  That would be like the best world of all}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2035, text:  is that we have like a little app store}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2036, text:  that's running on this platform.}, {speaker: spk_2, start: 2038, text:  And then we...}]}

{speaker: spk_0, start: 0, text:  You know, for stuff that runs through the Nounspace registry, we take a portion of the sales that are on there.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 7, text:  But there are several different avenues that we're exploring for it.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 15, text:  And definitely there's some growing emissions just from our passive sources like the token, like you said.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 22, text:  Whereas if we see another bull market and we take off and a lot of folks start staking into space and engaging with that token, that gives us also some more options for Runway.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 36, text:  Yeah, it's a great answer and something that we're definitely thinking about.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 42, text:  Also, we're being cognizant too of just like the friction that you can add by charging and that right now we do need to grow.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 49, text:  So making sure that we're balancing that. I think like TLDR, Dr. Doon is that ultimately our ability to be sustainable and profitable depends on our ability to get that product market fit.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 60, text:  I think if we do that, if we are a leading FarCaster client and a portal that a lot of users and communities are using to explore the web through universe and communicate and connect with each other, that's a great position to be in.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 72, text:  And there's a lot of opportunity to capture value there.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 75, text:  So definitely something that we're thinking about. But first and foremost, we just want to make sure that we focus on building something that users want and love.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 82, text:  But I will say we already have generated pretty significant revenues from happy paying users, which is really encouraging to see already at this early stage.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 93, text:  And I'm sorry, I haven't read the prop yet. How long is the six month or is this funding for generally everything seems to be like six months? Is it a theoretical six month period or does it have a timeline on it?}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 105, text:  Yeah, we've committed to a minimum of five months. Certainly what the goal basically is to extend runway as long as we can during these five months.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 114, text:  But what the 200K does guarantee basically is that we can compensate the existing team full time for a minimum of five months.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 122, text:  So we should assume that your necessary raises for another six months would be 200, hopefully plus, right? So possibly more because if you're expanding and you're doing more and need to hire more people.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 137, text:  So but at a minimum, not necessarily from here, but like just kind of thinking of how what type of numbers you need to achieve to keep everything rolling.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 145, text:  Because obviously people have lives, people got to eat, people have families. You can only do stuff on a shoestring budget for so long.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 155, text:  Right. Yeah, I think right now we don't have any specific plans to just come back in five or six months and request more.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 164, text:  I think the goal right now is basically to spend this 200K in this next five plus months to really validate our hypothesis here and our approach.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 174, text:  And if we do that, things can look quite a bit different. So if we find out in five months that just like we're building in the complete wrong direction and we can't get users to actually come and use noun space,}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 186, text:  then I think it'll be a very different conversation. And we certainly don't intend just to come back and say, hey, give us another five months to try and build something else.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 194, text:  But we'll have to, at least we have to look at how things are going. Hopefully, like you said, they are going very well. And if they're going well, then it's certainly possible that we won't need to come back.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 203, text:  And that's definitely been our goal. We don't want to just keep coming back and requesting funding from nouns forever. Like you said, people got to eat.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 210, text:  But we don't think, yeah, like these builders don't just want to eat. We want to build something awesome that changes the world.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 217, text:  And so, yeah, our goal isn't just to do that off of nouns funding, but to build something that can sustain itself. So ultimately depends on success, but that's definitely going to be our goal over the next five months.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 229, text:  And you can see the revenue projections at the link at the bottom of that path to sustainability section.}, {speaker: spk_0, start: 235, text:  Okay, perfect. I'll take a look. No, good luck, guys. I know you guys have been pretty hitting the road and pretty passionate about this. So good luck.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 246, text:  Thanks so much.}, {speaker: spk_1, start: 248, text:  All right. Sounds good. Yeah. If anyone else has any other questions or comments, definitely feel free to message the team.}
